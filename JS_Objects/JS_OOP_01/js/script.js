/* 
	This is a lesson in a JavaScript approach to Object Oriented Programming 

	This approach is also refered to as a Class-less, Prototype-oriented, or instanced-based Programming

	// TERMS
	Object
	Property
	Class
	Constructor
	Instantiation
	Method

	// OBJECTS
	OBJECTS are a great way to associate properties with a term or object. 
	The alternatvie would be creating a new variable for every possiblity. This can get very messy.
	Properties are customizable pieces of information for each object

*/


// CREATE AN OBJECT WITH OBJECT INITALIZER-- COLON and COMMAS
var obj ={
	name:'josh',
	type:'human'	
};

// CREATE AN OBJECT -- DOT SYNTAX AKA ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY
var obj2 = new Object();	
	obj2.name = "billy"
	obj2.type = "human"

/* 
	Open up console and type obj.name
	Now type obj2.name

	OBJECTS are great but when our programs grow in complexity we need to be a little more efficient.
	There are lots of redundat commands required to create each new object.
	Lets look at something many people personalzie. A phone case. 
	Move on to the next set of files.
